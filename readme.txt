Hides the content editor for the page currently selected as the "posts page". 

== Description ==

When you set a static page as your site's home page, you can select a different page to serve as the "posts page". This page will then display your most recent posts, instead of the page's content. This can be confusing for new users.

This plugin attempts to make this more intuitive by hiding the content editor for the "posts page", and displaying a short notice about the page's special status.

== Installation ==

Simply install the plugin through your WordPress admin, and activate it. There is nothing to configure.

To see it in action, take the following steps:

1. Under "settings -> Reading", make sure you have a static page selected as your site's home page.
2. If you haven't already, create a page to be used as the posts page.
3. Under "settings -> Reading", set that page as the posts page.
4. Go back to the posts page and edit it. The editor should now be hidden.

== Screenshots ==

1. Before: The editor is shown, even though the page's content will not be visible anywhere on the site
2. After: The content editor is hidden, and a small notice is displayed.
